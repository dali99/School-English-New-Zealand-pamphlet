			<p>The New Zealand flag has the Union Jack in its upper corner because New Zealand is a part of the british commonwealth, together with it's close neighbour Australia.</p>

			<h3 class="red">The British Commonwealth</h3>

			<p>The British Commonwealth is the traditional name for the now <strong>Commonwealth of Nations</strong> popularily reffered to as "The Commonwealth"</p>

			<p>Originally the Commonwealth was the entire british empire controlled by whomever controlled the actual crown. In modern times however it's more of a corporation, where the CEO position is given to the current King/Queen</p>

			<p>You could even go so far and say that the commonwealth is an <i>olligarchic corporatocracy!</i></p>
