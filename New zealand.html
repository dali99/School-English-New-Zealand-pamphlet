			<!--<p>The New Zealand flag has the Union Jack in its upper corner because New Zealand is a part of the british commonwealth, together with it's close neighbour Australia.</p>-->

			<h1 class="red">History</h1>
			<p>Obviously both Australia and New Zealand share a lot of history, seeing as they are both in the the  british commonwealth.</p>
			<h3 class="red">The British Commonwealth</h3>

			<p>The British Commonwealth is the traditional name for the now <strong>Commonwealth of Nations</strong> popularily reffered to as "The Commonwealth"</p>

			<p>Originally the Commonwealth was the entire british empire controlled by whomever controlled the actual crown. In modern times however it's more of a corporation, where the CEO position is given to the current King/Queen</p>

			<p>You could even go so far and say that the commonwealth is an <i>olligarchic corporatocracy!</i></p>

			<p>CGP Gray has made a great image for understanding how the british crown influences the world</p>

			<h1 class="red">Geography</h1>
			<p>New Zealand lies in Oceania, in the southern hemisphere. The climate is both cold and wet, similar to Norway, but perhaps their winters are a bit warmer.</p>
			<p>The country is filled with beautiful mountains and canyons, green grass, and sheep, lots and lots of sheep. Seriously, there are more sheep in New Zealand than people. That's a lot of sheep.</p>
			<p>In many ways New Zealand looks a lot like norway, and their nature, is where most of their tourism comes from</p>

			<p>If you're vistiting New Zealand, you will  most likely go to Auckland, as it is decidably the biggest city in New Zealand, with a population of 1.413.700 people. Which is larger than the capital, mind you.</p>
			<p>On second place, (in terms of population anyway). is Welligton, the capital, a place known for their coffee, and they take credit for inventing the "flat white" - a coffee with less milk, and the milk being textured, rather than frossy. Whatever that means...</p>

			<h1 class="red">Tourism</h1>
			<p>New Zealand is a country many filmmakes choose to film in because of its spectacular nature. Movies like 'Lord of the rings', 'Avatar', and 'The Hobbit'. </p>
			<p>Which isnt really a surprise seeing as James Cameron himself was born there</p>
			<p>Suffice to say, a lot of fans travel to New Zealand to see the movie sets But many people also go hiking, taking trips to mighty volcanoes. And good sights.</p>
