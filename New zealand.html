			<h1 class="red">History</h1>
			<p>Obviously both Australia and New Zealand share a lot of history, seeing as they are both in the the  british commonwealth.</p>
			<p>New Zealand was first discovered by the Polynesians in the start of the 14th century. The polynesians settled and became the indigenous people of New Zealand, the Maori.</p>

			<p>New Zealand was then re-discovered by british sailor James Cook. Who was the first person to sail around, and map New Zealand. After that many people visited the  Country, for trading, exploring, or maybe just to silence their ache for adventure!</p>

			<p>In 1840 New Zealand joined the British Empir, with the treaty of Waitangi, giving Maori people "equal rights" with British citizens</p>

			<h3 class="red">The British Commonwealth</h3>

			<p>The British Commonwealth is the traditional name for the now <strong>Commonwealth of Nations</strong> popularily reffered to as "The Commonwealth"</p>

			<p>Originally the Commonwealth was the entire british empire controlled by whomever controlled the actual crown. In modern times however it's more of a corporation, where the CEO position is given to the current King/Queen</p>

			<p>You could even go so far and say that the commonwealth is an <i>olligarchic corporatocracy!</i> (while countries themselves can be democratic olligarchic corporatocracy. Except for the the crown dependencies, poor Jersey)</p>

			<p>CGP Gray has made a great image for understanding how the british crown influences the world:</p>

			<h1 class="red">Geography</h1>
			<p>New Zealand lies in Oceania, in the southern hemisphere. The climate is both cold and wet, similar to Norway, but perhaps their winters are a bit warmer.</p>
			<p>The country is filled with beautiful mountains and canyons, green grass, and sheep, lots and lots of sheep. Seriously, there are more sheep in New Zealand than people. That's a lot of sheep.</p>
			<p>In many ways New Zealand looks a lot like Norway, and their nature, is where most of their tourism comes from.</p>

			<p>The largest mountain in New Zealand is Mount Cook, with a height of 3.724 meters.</p>

			<p>As for the longest river, that's the Waikato river. And the Maori has long thought of it as a source for mana. Which is a fuel for magic, and pride.</p>

			<p>Some animals you're likely to see, andd some you might hope to see are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Sheep</p></li>
				<li><p>Rabbits</p></li>
				<li><p>Possum - often found lying in the road (probably not just playing possum, sorry)</p></li>
				<li><p>Elk</p></li>
				<li><p>Deer - Imagine that, they even have elks and deers!</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>New Zealand also has a lot of birds! And maybe most important, is their national animal, the kiwi.</p>

			<p>If you're vistiting New Zealand, you will  most likely go to Auckland, as it is decidably the biggest city in New Zealand, with a population of 1.413.700 people. Which is larger than the capital, mind you.</p>
			<p>On second place, (in terms of population anyway). is Welligton, the capital, a place known for their coffee, and they take credit for inventing the "flat white" - a coffee with less milk, and the milk being textured, rather than frossy. Whatever that means...</p>

			<h1 class="red">Politics!</h1>
			<p>New Zeaand is what is known as a parliamentary representative democratic monarchy. Basically excactly how the british political system works, and closely remblent of Norway. New Zealand dpes however recognize the British queen as the head of state.</p>

			<p>The current Prime Minister, John Key has recently come in trouble for pulling a waitress ponytail. Which international media recognized as "ponyytail-gate", even so his party. The National party, gets 47% of the election votes. While their strongest oppsition, labour, only gets 27%</p>
			
			<h2 class="red">Money</h2>
			<p>In New Zealand they use a currency called "New Zealand Dollars", or NZD. One NZD is about 5,5kr NOK.</p>

			<p>Similar to other countries in the British commnwealth, their bills have images of the british queen.</p>


			<h1 class="red">Famous People</h1>
			<p>New Zealand doesn't have a lot of famous people. But the ones they have, are very well known.</p>
			<h2 class="red">Lorde</h2>
			<img src="http://www.filmoria.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Lorde-2014.jpg" class="general_info">
			<p class="small">yes that Lorde</p>
			<p>Lorde is a famous popstar, electropop, artist. One of her most known songs is "Royals", but she's also featured in for example "Meltdown" and "Ladder", both songs in "The Hunger Games Mocking Jay: Pt. 1"</p>

			<h2 class="red">Peter Jackson</h2>
			<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Peter_Jackson_SDCC_2014.jpg/640px-Peter_Jackson_SDCC_2014.jpg" class="general_info">
			<p>Peter Jackson, born in 1963, was the director of all the Lord of the rings movies, and all the Hobbit movies. Movies that have all been wildly popular, and won multiple academy awards. (Well except 'The Lovely Bones', but we don't talk about that).</p>
			<p>Jackson has a net worth of $600 Million USD, which puts him at a fourth place under George Lucas, Spielberg, and James Cameron. Just above Micheal Bay. (neat!)</p>

			<p>He also direcred the 2005 version of 'King Kong'. And helped Spielberg in directing 'The Adventures of Tintin'</p>

			<h1 class="red">Tourism</h1>
			<p>New Zealand is a country many filmmakes choose to film in because of its spectacular nature. Movies like 'Lord of the rings', 'Avatar', and 'The Chronicles of Narnia', were all filmed here, so next time you watch a Peter Jackson film, assume the amazing landscape is New Zealand!</p>
			<p>Which isnt really a surprise seeing as Peter Jackson himself was born here</p>
			<p>Suffice to say, a lot of fans travel to New Zealand to see the movie sets, But many people also go hiking, taking trips to mighty volcanoes. And looking at pretty birds, and/or dolphins.</p>
			<p>but let's say you're a hardcore Lord of the Rings fan. What can you see?</p>
			<p>you can for example go see The Shire.</p> <img src="http://farm1.nzstatic.com/_proxy/imageproxy_1y/serve/hobbiton-movie-set-toursmatamata--lord-of-the-ringstour.jpg?height=660&outputformat=jpg&quality=75&source=1121291&transformationsystem=crop&width=1920&securitytoken=EA03AFD11105F4C25949336BABEEB888" class="general_info">
			<p>Or the Waitomo Caves. A beautiful glowing cave which has been a popular tourist attraction since 1904, and maybe even before!</p>
